Gym. Music. Player Version 2. Instead of using tkinter for the UI, it now uses Electron for cross platform accessibilty

The main issue with the first G.M.P is that it only worked on my computer. It works well as a desktop application for personal use but I was never able to download the program onto my raspberry pi tablet. I tried using docker without knowing that docker isn't typically used to "publish" final application but rather a way to share a program while in development. I am now using Electron to solve the cross platform issue and who knows. Maybe I can make the UI look alot better and even publish a way to download a user friendly music desktop app on my personal website.

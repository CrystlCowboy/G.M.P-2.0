Gym. Music. Player Version 2. Instead of using tkinter for the UI, it now uses Electron for cross platform accessibilty (which was the main issue with the first G.M.P).

G.M.P V1 was ideal for a desktop music player for my personal use but was never able to transfer to my Raspberry Pi computer successfully. This V2 will solve the cross-platform issue.
